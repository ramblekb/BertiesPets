Bertie’s Pets

Berties Pets is a full stack app that loads, deletes and updates a list of pets in a database. It is a mock petstore manager allowing staff to change the status of their pets from ‘available’ ‘pending’ and ‘sold’ then saving that data in the database. This is a MERN full stack that executes CRUD operations. I built this application to be a fast and secure method of updating status and displaying data. The app simplifies updating status. It is quick, easy and does not rely on page reload. The app is a centralized record for all the pets that have been accepted into the petstore database. Building the app I learned how to use unique attributes to update an objects state. I also learned material ui’s pagination styles. This application is successful in achieving its goal with very little navigation or ui. It is also lightweight and a single component therefore easily added to other applications if you wanted. 

The app is built on Reactjs with node modules mongoose, express, react router, axios, material ui and bootstrap. When the server starts the app listens to mongodb on port 3001 and port 3000 compiles the components and displays the app. 

STEPS
Step 1) clone GitHub repository 
Step 2) npm install node modules, create package.Json locked
Step 3) start mongodb by running mongod in terminal and connect to mongodb (leave running in background)
Step 4) node scripts/seedDB.js to populate the data and create database
Step 5) npm start in root directory: and you should successfully be listening to the API server running on 3001 & client should compile and display on your https localhost 3000
Step 6) click the colored button to update pet status 


THIS Project is dedicated to my dog Bertie!
